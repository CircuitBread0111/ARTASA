# ARTASA

![ARTASA Device Image](path/to/your/image.jpg)

**ARTASA** is a handheld robotic vision system designed to assist individuals who have difficulty reading due to blindness, dyslexia, or other vision impairments.

## Overview

Many people with these conditions struggle to determine whether an object contains text. **ARTASA** addresses these challenges by processing the environment, detecting and interpreting text, and converting it into speech using text-to-speech (TTS) software.

## Key Features

- **Robotic Vision:** Detects and processes text in the environment.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Converts identified text into spoken words.
- **Accessible Design:** Compact and easy to use for a range of users with visual impairments.
- **Efficient Processing:** Optimized for fast, accurate text recognition and audio output.

## System Architecture

The system operates through three primary stages:

1. **Image Acquisition**  
   Utilizes a dedicated Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) camera module to capture images with optimal resolution and color balance.

2. **Image & Text Processing**  
   Processes images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect and interpret text.

3. **Audio Output**  
   Converts recognized text into audio using TTS, speaking only when text confidence is 75% or higher.

## Hardware Components

- **SPI Camera Module** – Captures high-quality images for OCR.
- **Raspberry Pi** – Serves as the main processing unit for software management and data processing.

## Benefits

- **Hands-Free Operation**  
  The device simplifies the process of scanning and reading text from various objects in different environments.

- **Adaptive Design**  
  The compact and handheld nature allows it to be easily used in diverse settings.
